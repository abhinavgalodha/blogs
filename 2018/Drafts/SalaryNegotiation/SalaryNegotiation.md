## Do i need a Salary Raise?

There may be myriad reasons for the Salary Raise. Are you preparing for the Next annual Review meeting with your manager. Some of the possible reasons are mentioned below.

* Annual Increment is pending.
* You might be Joining a new company.
* Not satisfied with the current salary and need to ask for a raise.
* If you have another offer, then best time to Negotiate.

## Yes, I need a Salary Raise, what's next?

Foremost, do your homework and make a plan and understand **Do's** and **Don't**  and considerations which can help in getting the best deal. Also, bear in mind following points as you prepare yourselve.


<TODO - Introspection Gif>

* Start with Self. Introspect and take a look at what you are currently doing and what you want to do in near future. Do the SWOT (Strength, Weakness, Oppurtunities and Threat) analysis and question yourselve.
* Find out a Salary range which is acceptable to you.
* Other than Salary, what other benefits can you consider and prioritize benefits as per your liking.

Finally, It's never too late. It better to ask for a raise than just wondering about it.

## How much do you deserve?

Other than doing your own self assessment, it is imperative to look at the external resources to Collobaorate your findings.

* Analyze the *Specific Position* in your *Area* and how much salary is offered for that particular Role. Get the concrete information Like a Asp.net Web API developer with 5 Year of Experience Earns XXX amount at particular *location*. Position, Role, Years of Experience, Technology Demand, your Skillset and Location are keywords. The salary will vary depending on these factors.

* There are valuable resources online to calculate and compare the salary based on above factors. Use sources like GlassDoor, Payscale, Stackoverflow Salary Calculator to get the Salary estimates. Don't stick to these numbers, these are just guiding figures to help you figure out what the market currently offers for the specific position.

* Analyze how much the company that you are working/expected to join pays for that specific Position.

* Also, take a look at how the company is doing. If they have made profit over last year, then probably a good time to ask for raise. If it has loss, lay off, then probably not a good time. Assess the conditions of a company and then prepare accordingly.

## Things to do before negotiation

* Know more about the decision maker. Research about them, use Social media/Linkedin to get information about their profile, what kind of work they have done and what kind of colleagues they work with.

* Think what Hiring Manager is interested in and why they might be asking a question. Not just think about answering a question. Their might be a covert reason for asking the question. Try figuring those Covert reasons and mold your answer accordingly.

* Everyone has a different viewpoint. Understand the person you are talking to and analyze and adapt. HR manager might have one view, but your manager might have different view for the same issue. Try to work with different personalities.

* Be prepared for tough questions. Don't wish and pray that Hiring Manager wouldn't ask that Tough question which you are not able to answer. Take your time and prepare for the tough questions. You might have some years of Gap between Completion of Education and Employment. Think and prepare how you can explain this to Hiring Manager. List all the questions that make you uncomfortable and try to get answers and be prepared to answer those questions. Do you don't have offers during summer internship? So, don't be thinking that Hiring Manager will not ask, but rather prepare. The hiring manager throws some difficult questions, and if you are not able to handle it gracefully, you will be be loosing the plot.

* Mike Tyson - Everyone has a plan until they are punched in the face… Similary, during negotiation process, all is looking well and you have prepared everything and then

## What should I keep in mind during negotiation?

* **Stay Calm, Polite and respectful.** Easy to say, but difficult to do, this will not happen in a day but you need imbibe calmness in yourselve and it will take time. Try Meditation or any other thing which helps you keep calm.

* Look at the entire deal and the bigger picture. Fixed Salary might be the most important thing, but don't ignore other things like Yearly Bonus, Equity, Insurance Coverage, Travel allowance, work environment etc. Look at the entire package and don't be narrow minded and worrry about the fixed Salary.Other benefits should be considered while considering the overall Salary Negotiation. You might get a better overall deal while still getting a lower Fixed salary as per your expectations.

* Hiring Managers might have constraints, try to understand those but don't go in the details like why the Salary is fixed for a employee at a particular Grade/Band/Level.  

* Present all your Priorities together in one meeting. Don't come up with new demands in every meeting. It can be irritating for the hiring manager and they might think that you are not clear and confused.  

I have made this mistake. In the first meeting, i mentioned that i need X salary, in next meeting again told the hiring manager that i need X+Y salary and in next meeting when they were ready to offer X+Y Salary, i demanded another benefit. As you might be able to imagine this didn't go well and i didn't get all i desired. The learning for me was clear that i need to be better prepared and think about Salary and all benefits before first meeting and present them together.

* Don't haggle/fight for every small thing, this will make them dislike you.

* When someone says "No" in a negotiation. It means that at that point in time the answer was "No". But, it may change at some time in future. It might change in 3 months from now on, the situation might be different in future and what they were not able to offer 3 months ago, they might be able to offer you now.

* Form your request as a question not as a directive. 

* Give yourself a way to accept offer. Think about what you can compromise on and accept the offer. Don't be rigid and be flexible and open to alternative form of compensations or other give yourself other options.

* Stay at the table - Stay in touch

## Don't in Negotiation

> Never Lie in the Nogiation.

* Don't lie in a negotiation. Never, Never, Never Lie in a Negotiation. Hiring manager have experience and are smarter than you think, they might be able to catch your lies and if it happens than you would loose trust and wouldn't get favourable deal.

* Compare your salary to some of your Colleague. This is the most common thing that i have seen with most of the employees.

* Don't accept or make ultimatums.


* Give a Range. Because employer would go for a lower range. Also, give the hiring manager that you are not sure what you want..
* Emotional or tell you have a big family to serve.. Only share if you the Decision Maker in person..


## How do I get more? How to ask for Higher Salary?

If your salary is in the range for similar jobs in the industry, that's going to be a ceiling on any salary increase. In that case, , but you're going to have to tie it to some concrete numbers. If you're already making more than the competition, then you have some work ahead of you to justify that raise you want, so read on.

> Make them like you. The more they like you. The more chances of raise.

* you might want to push for a one-time bonus or other variable compensation rather than a straight annual increase.

* Sharpen the saw..

* Be a doer

* Create things rather than doing the rot.

* Understand the priority of the team, direction and align to the goals. Like they want more user acceptance.

* Be innovative, leadership.

* Communicate Your achievements

* Make sure your boss and other key personnel understand when the reason things are "running smoothly" is you. This is an ongoing process. In other words, you need to constantly remind them when you contribute to a major success or preempt a significant problem. Be prepared to summarize those achievements when you talk about your raise.

* Talk about the value that you bring into the Company.  
 	* Saved Time by automating a process.
 	* Increase productivity.
 	* Value saved in $.

* Have you taken additional Responsibilities.. (for e.g. Not just a developer, but a high level understanding of the )

* If your duties have changed, remind your boss. Even better, put a figure on the savings or gain to the employer from your additional work and make your raise reflect a reasonable percentage of that savings.
	* Leading in 2 Projects. Earlier only one..
	*  Interview and selecting candidates.
	* Trust with leadership. 
	* Supervised People..

* Have you completed a successful project?
	○ AppDynamics (Monitoring)
	○ Customer Story & Collaboration

* Talk about your accomplishments.
	○ Deployed first Microservices on asp.net core and then on Docker, container and cloud.
	○ Detailed Monitoring solution for the application..

*  Don't complain. A positive approach as to why you deserve a raise will get you more than a screed against co-workers you feel are overpaid or aren't performing as well as you are..

* Record milestone. Most importantly, tie your performance to an increase in sales, revenue, or better yet, profit for your employer. While your hard work should be rewarded, it's a lot easier for your boss to give you $3,000 or $5,000 more if you've actively contributed to a bump in revenue of, say, $50,000.
	
* It's not always easy to know how much you contribute to the bottom line, and it's certainly easier in some jobs than in others. A sales representative can typically point at monthly reports to justify a bump in salary, but other workers have to be more creative. For example, a bartender may know that the till at the end of his shift is a lot higher than at the end of someone else's, or an auditor might complete audits on average faster and with less client pushback than her colleagues. Whatever measure you use, try to come up with a reasonably objective measure of your performance (and value to the employer) in any discussion about compensation.

## What to do if the Salary is fixed (Non-Negotiable)?

Let's accept it, certain time the Hiring manager has to abide by the policies and procedures and can't offer the salary beyond a certain limit. What should you do in such situations. Be flexible and look at the bigger picture and try to substiture the salary for other perks. Following are some of the ways which you can allow yourself a chance when the salary is fixed.

* Take Equity if Base Pay is fixed. Check if company can offer certain shares of the company.

* Negotiate for things which they can give us in the future. Like 6 months, 1 year, e.g. bonus after completion of 1 year.

* Check with your manager have they ever compensated other employees in different ways for salary hike, what has been other mediums?
 
* you join mid term (pro-rata).. And also make sure you follow-up With them.. Look for a better deal which include complete package - salary, location, benefits..

* If you are doing well, can they look at revisiting the salary in the next Cycle..

* Any Additional Benefits and perks..

* Negotiate for better projects, 

* Flexibility in Locations.

* 1, 2 Conference in an year, logistics around training and learning..

* Offer explanations for any increase or any favors offer why…

## Introspection

Remember that working hard or working long hours is not the be all and end all for an increase in salary. If it takes you longer to do something than it takes your peers, you're not likely to get a raise for that. Similarly, if your work process is inefficient, resulting in a lot of effort for the same result, that's probably not going to get you a raise. Improving that process or improving your performance may.

## Final Note

* Be happy
* Content  - How much people earning.
* Enjoy the journey.
* It's not all about salary.
* Look for a change…
