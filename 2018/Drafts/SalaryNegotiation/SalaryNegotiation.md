How much do you deserve?
	• Analyze the Specific Position in your Area and how much salary.. Be well prepared about some concrete information.
		○ GlassDoor, Payscale, Stackoverflow Salary Calculator
	• Analyze how much the company pays for that specific Position.
	• Take a look at how the company is doing. If they have made profit over last year, then probably a good time to ask for raise. If it has loss, lay off, then probably not a good time
	To ask for the raise.
	
Things to do before first negotiation
	• Know more about the decision maker. Research about them, use Social media/linkedin to get information about their profile and what kind of candidates have they hired in the past.
	• Understand the person you are talking to. HR manager might have one view, but your manager might have different view. Different person
	Have different style, check and analyze and adapt.
	• Think what Hiring Manager is interested in why they might be asking a question. Not just think about answering a question. Their might be a covert reason for asking the question. Try figuring those..
	• Be prepared for tough questions. Do you don't have offers during summer internship? So, don't be thinking that interviewers will not ask, but rather prepare..
	• Mike Tyson - Everyone has a plan until they are punched in the face… Similary, during negotiation process, all is looking well and you have prepared everything and then
	The hiring manager throws some difficult questions, and if you are not able to handle it gracefully, you will be be loosing the plot..
	

What should I keep in mind during negotiation?
	• Stay Calm, Polite and respectful.
	• Look at the entire deal and the bigger picture. Like what will you get In future..
	• Stay at the table - Stay in touch..
	• They might have constraints, try to understand those but don't go in the details… or prove too much..
	• Let them know your priority and present them together. Don't do one more thing, one more thing.. It can be irritating..
	• Don't haggle/fight for every small thing, this will make them dislike you..
	• When someone says "No" in a negotiation. It means that at that point in time the answer was "No". But, it may change at some time in future..
	• Form your request as a question not as a directive.
	• Give yourself a way to accept offer..
	

	
How do I get more? How to ask for Higher Salary?

If your salary is in the range for similar jobs in the industry, that's going to be a ceiling on any salary increase. In that case, , but you're going to have to tie it to some concrete numbers. If you're already making more than the competition, then you have some work ahead of you to justify that raise you want, so read on.

	• Make them like you. The more they like you. The more chances of raise.
	• If you have another offer, then best time to Negotiate..
	• you might want to push for a one-time bonus or other variable compensation rather than a straight annual increase.
	• Sharpen the saw..
	• Be a doer
	• Create things rather than doing the rot.
	• Understand the priority of the team, direction and align to the goals. Like they want more user acceptance.
	• Be innovative, leadership.
	• Communicate Your achievements
	Make sure your boss and other key personnel understand when the reason things are "running smoothly" is you. This is an ongoing process. In other words, you need to constantly remind them when you contribute to a major success or preempt a significant problem. Be prepared to summarize those achievements when you talk about your raise.
	• Talk about the value that you bring into the Company.  
		○ Saved Time by automating a process.
		○ Increase productivity.
		○ Value saved in $.
	• Have you taken additional Responsibilities.. (for e.g. Not just a developer, but a high level understanding of the )
	If your duties have changed, remind your boss. Even better, put a figure on the savings or gain to the employer from your additional work and make your raise reflect a reasonable percentage of that savings.
		○ Leading in 2 Projects. Earlier only one..
		○ Interview and selecting candidates.
		○ Trust with leadership. 
	• Supervised People..
	• Have you completed a successful project?
		○ AppDynamics (Monitoring)
		○ Customer Story & Collaboration
	• Talk about your accomplishments.
		○ Deployed first Microservices on asp.net core and then on Docker, container and cloud.
		○ Detailed Monitoring solution for the application..
	• Don't complain. A positive approach as to why you deserve a raise will get you more than a screed against co-workers you feel are overpaid or aren't performing as well as you are..
	• Record milestone. Most importantly, tie your performance to an increase in sales, revenue, or better yet, profit for your employer. While your hard work should be rewarded, it's a lot easier for your boss to give you $3,000 or $5,000 more if you've actively contributed to a bump in revenue of, say, $50,000.
	It's not always easy to know how much you contribute to the bottom line, and it's certainly easier in some jobs than in others. A sales representative can typically point at monthly reports to justify a bump in salary, but other workers have to be more creative. For example, a bartender may know that the till at the end of his shift is a lot higher than at the end of someone else's, or an auditor might complete audits on average faster and with less client pushback than her colleagues. Whatever measure you use, try to come up with a reasonably objective measure of your performance (and value to the employer) in any discussion about compensation.
	
	
What do if the Salary is fixed (Non-Negotiable)?
	• Take Equity if Base Pay is fixed..
	• Boss - Have you ever compensated other people in different ways for salary hike, what has been other mediums.
	• Negotiate for things which they can give us in the future.. Like 6 months, 1 year, e.g. bonus for complete year if
		○  you join mid term (pro-rata).. And also make sure you follow-up With them.. Look for a better deal which include complete package - salary, location, benefits..
	• If you are doing well, can they look at revisiting the salary in the next Cycle..
	• Any Additional Benefits and perks..
	• Negotiate for better projects, 
	• Flexibility in Locations.
	• 1, 2 Conference in an year, logistics around training and learning..
	• Offer explanations for any increase or any favors offer why…
	
Don't in Negotiation
	• Don't lie in a negotiation.
	• Don't accept or make ultimatums..
	• Compare your salary to some of your Colleague.
	• Give a Range. Because employer would go for a lower range. Also, give the hiring manager that you are not sure what you want..
	• Emotional or tell you have a big family to serve.. Only share if you the Decision Maker in person..
	
If Employer asks for your salary?

I am willing to entertain any reasonable offer. Or give them some range…

When Employer gives you a number?
Think about it and come back later..

Introspection
Remember that working hard or working long hours is not the be all and end all for an increase in salary. If it takes you longer to do something than it takes your peers, you're not likely to get a raise for that. Similarly, if your work process is inefficient, resulting in a lot of effort for the same result, that's probably not going to get you a raise. Improving that process or improving your performance may.

	• Enjoy the journey.
	• It's not all about salary..
Look for a change…
