## Introduction

* Have you ever run into problem and thought about debugging a library source code to understand the actual implementation? 
* Have you searched across the internet and didn't found any details for your issue?

## Problem

A type with multiple constructor which constructor would be used.




## How to debug 



## Cloning and debugging

Clone the repository

## Actual Debugging

Open tests and modify the code.

## My Problem code

Can see the exception, when more than 1 parameterized it is throwing an exception.

## Conclusion

In this article we learned how to Debug and open source library project like JSON.net and identify and understand the expected behavior. We added our code in tests and debugged the Desexualization code to understand why the code is behaving in a certain way. Also, it was a good learning experience to read some one else code. I hope you enjoyed the article and  next time you run into a mysterious behavior, you will try to debug the Libraries code.
